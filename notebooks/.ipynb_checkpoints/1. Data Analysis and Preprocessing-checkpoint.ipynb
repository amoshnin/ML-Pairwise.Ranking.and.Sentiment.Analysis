    "You could build a model of character to character transitions from a bunch of text in English. So for example, you find out how common it is for there to be a 'h' after a 't' (pretty common). In English, you expect that after a 'q', you'll get a 'u'. If you get a 'q' followed by something other than a 'u', this will happen with very low probability, and hence it should be pretty alarming. Normalize the counts in your tables so that you have a probability. Then for a query, walk through the matrix and compute the product of the transitions you take. Then normalize by the length of the query. When the number is low, you likely have a gibberish query (or something in a different language).\n",
